# Week 5 Tuesday Activity: Communication and Content Infrastructure

Your team needs to define roles and determine regular meeting times. (You won't be able to get everything done just in the times that the class meets.) You also  need to set up the infrastructure for your team communication

While you can choose your own tools, I highly recommend that you set up the following:

* GitHub (or other git-based version control) site for your project code
* [Google "Team Drive"](https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/drive/get-started-team-drive/) for non-code documents
* Slack workspace (or a set of specific channels in the existing class Slack workspace) for project-related communication and updates
* [Trello](https://trello.com) or [GitHub Project](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) for Kanban-style project management
* Integrations among your various tools
    * [Slack and Trello](https://trello.com/platforms/slack)
    * [Slack and GitHub](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/232289568-Use-GitHub-with-Slack)
    * [Slack and Google Drive](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205875058-Google-Drive-for-Slack)
 
 Once you've got your tools in place, start thinking about your design and development timeline. Keep in mind that development and testing are an iterative process, so you need to build that into your planning.
