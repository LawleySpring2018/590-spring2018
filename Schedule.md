## <a name="week1">Week 1</a> (Jan 15/17): Course Overview & Tourism Crash Course

On Tuesday we'll review the syllabus, and talk about the overall goals of the two classes. We'll discuss a variety of tools that we'll be using both for course materials and communication, and for game development and team management. I'll also provide an overall introduction to the topic of games and tourism. 

On Thursday we'll do a crash course in tourism basics, with a focus on the intersection with game design concepts.
