## <a name="week1">Week 1</a> (Jan 15/17): Course Overview & Tourism Crash Course

On Monday we'll review the syllabus, and talk about the overall goals of the two classes. We'll discuss a variety of tools that we'll be using both for course materials and communication, and for game development and team management. I'll also provide an overall introduction to the topic of games and tourism. 

On Wednesday we'll do a crash course in tourism basics, with a focus on the intersection with game design concepts.

## <a name="week3">Week 3</a> (Jan 29/31): Examples of Games in Tourism (590); Dubrovnik-Specific Challenges (580)

On Monday we'll talk about a variety of existing games related to tourism, and I'll discuss the difference between serious games, gamification, and gameful design. ([Monday's slides](week3-gameful-design.pdf)). 

On Wednesday we'll focus on Dubrovnik-specific tourism challenges and opportunities. On Wednesday, we'll have a guest lecture and conversation with Nikša Vlahušić from [DURA](http://dura.hr/), the City of Dubrovnik Development Agency. 

***Before class on Monday, in addition to the readings, please install the Ingress game on your phone and spend some time playing it. If you don't have data on your phone, team up with a classmate who does.***

### Monday Activity: Ingress vs Pokemon Go
Spend at least an hour in the old town playing each of these games (either 30 minutes with each, or an hour alternating between the two). Partner with one other person, and take turns playing and observing the other person play. How does playing each of the games change your experience of the city? What did you see or experience that you didn't when you explored on your own? What did you miss? You should write up your notes about this right afterwards, so that they're fresh in your mind. 

Before Wednesday's class, choose and complete at least one mission in Ingress, either on your own or with a partner. (Note: If the mission has a number associated with it, it's probably because the badges are designed to create a mosaic image if the missions are completed in order. While it's possible to reorder later, it can only be done by redoing the missions--so it's best to start with the first in the sequence if possible.) When you're done, use the share icon in the top right corner of the Agent screen to take a screenshot of your Ingress profile, and post it to the #ingress channel in Slack.

### Wednesday Activity: Evaluating Self-Guided Tours 
On Wednesday, I will divide you into groups of 2 or 3, and give you a specific self-guided tour of Dubrovnik to follow. Some of you will be given a printed tour from a guidebook, others will use a mobile web or app based tour.  As you do the tour, think about how it differs from your unstructured wandering using Siftr, and your game-focused exploration using Ingress and Pokemon Go. What do you like about the tour? What don't you like? What would like to see changed? As you did on Monday, write down your notes during and after the tour.

### Week 3 Deliverables
By Saturday at 8am, you should submit a brief (one page) write-up of your experiences from the activities on Monday and Wednesday. Include a discussion of why you chose your faction in Ingress. 

In your weekly journal, connect the dots between the readings, the games, and the tours that you took. What did you learn. How has it influenced your game ideas?

Start thinking about what game you want to pitch to the class. We will work on no more than two games this semester, because I don't want you working in groups smaller than four. I will make the final decision on which games we develop, but you will all have signficant input into that decision. Pitches will be next Wednesday (7 Feb). 

## <a name="week4">Week 4</a> (Feb 5/7): Geogames and Location-Based Games (590); Initial Game Pitches (580)

On Monday of this week, we'll look at and talk about location-based games, geogames, augmented reality games, and mixed reality games. (Which are similar, and can overlap, but are not identical). We'll also start brainstorming ideas about Dubrovnik games, including possible audiences, themes, and platforms. 

On Wednesday, you should come prepared to pitch at least one idea for a game to work on this semester. After the pitches, we'll critique and refine the ideas. I'll create a Slack channel for the ideas, and you'll have until next Monday to ask questions of each other, revise your ideas, and even to add new ones. On Monday of week 5, we'll decide as a group which game or games we're going to work on for the rest of the semester. 

At 4pm on Wednesday, Owen Gottlieb will be giving a talk about his game "Jewish Time Jump"--please make sure you've read the article (posted in myCourses) before class!
