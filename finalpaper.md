|----|----|----|

#  Final Paper

## Option One: Future Game Opportunities
Identify and describe opportunities for games (beyond what you worked on in Production Studio) that would address challenges faced by either tourists or tourism providers in Dubrovnik (or another tourist destination). What kind of games do you think would be effective? Why? What would be involved in creating them? 

## Option Two: Lessons Learned
Using what you've learned over the semester, including the readings and presentations for this class and your attendance at the Reboot Conference, answer two questions about your 580 project:

* If you could go back and start over, what would you do differently? 
* If you six more months to work on this project full time, what would you add and/or change?

For each question, you should discuss your own learning and role in the project, as well as the game as a whole.


## Requirements

* The paper is due by noon on Tuesday, 8 May. It must be submitted to the Dropbox in myCourses in Word (.doc or .docx) or PDF format. 
* There is no set length requirement, but you should provide enough detail for me to be able to effectively assess how well you've understood and applied the concepts we've discussed. 
* It should be spell-checked and proofread. Proper grammar and word usage is required.
