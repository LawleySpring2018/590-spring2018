# Week 2 Exercise: Using Siftr for Collaborative Mapping

## Monday: Dubrovnik's Old Town
Today you'll be using [Siftr](http://siftr.org) to create a collaborative map of the Old Town. I've created a Siftr called ["Experiencing Dubrovnik's Old Town"](https://siftr.org/dubrovnikoldtown/), and you should be able to find it by searching for "Dubrovnik" in the Siftr app. 

Siftr allows you to take a photo, assign a category to it, add a description, and have it be attached to the map in your current location. (You can also edit the location at the time, or later.) 

As you explore the city, I don't want you to record traditional "points of interest" like museums and statues. Instead, I want you to think about how the things you see make you feel. What do you see that makes you happy? Sad? Confused? Frustrated? Entertained? I've created categories to reflect a wide range of emotional responses. (If there's something not there that you'd like me to add, let me know. You can change an entry's category at any time.) Make sure you add an explanation for your choice of categories. (More information is better; stories are great.)

You can use an existing walking tour from a book or app (GPS My City has several walking tour options) to guide you through the city, or you can simply explore on your own. Make sure you explore beyond the Stradun and the walls!)

You can walk with other students, but I'd prefer that you keep it to groups of no more than three, so that there's variation in what's seen and experienced. Whether you're solo or in a group, I'd like person to add at least five items. (Try to avoid duplicates, unless you have a very different experience of the same location/item.)

If the app doesn't place your photo accurately, or if you add the photos after the fact, make sure you use the item editor in the web interface to select the correct location. 

## Wednesday: Mt. Srdj and the Museum of Croatian War of Independence
Today you'll be adding photos to http://siftr.org/mtsrdj-memories. Instead of the wide range of emotions provided for categories in the Old Town map, this map uses only five categories, ranging from "very negative" to "very positive". (Negative emotions could include sadness, anger, frustration, etc.) Please make sure that you add a description explaining what the photo represents, and what the emotion was that you were experiencing. 


## Deliverable (due 8am Sunday, 28 January)
I expect your photos (at least five per map), with accurate location, category, and description, to be added to the Siftr no later than 8am on Sunday. If your username is not obviously linked to your name or RIT ID, please make sure you add it to the apprpriate thread in Slack so that I can search for your contributions.
