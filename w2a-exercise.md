# Week 2 Monday Exercise: Using Siftr to Map the Old Town

Today you'll be using [Siftr](http://siftr.org) to create a collaborative map of the Old Town. I've created a Siftr called ["Experiencing Dubrovnik's Old Town"](https://siftr.org/dubrovnikoldtown/), and you should be able to find it by searching for "Dubrovnik" in the Siftr app. 

Siftr allows you to take a photo, assign a category to it, add a description, and have it be attached to the map in your current location. (You can also edit the location at the time, or later.) 

As you explore the city, I don't want you to record traditional "points of interest" like museums and statues. Instead, I want you to think about how the things you see make you feel. What do you see that makes you happy? Sad? Confused? Frustrated? Entertained? I've created categories to reflect a wide range of emotional responses. (If there's something not there that you'd like me to add, let me know. You can change an entry's category at any time.) Make sure you add an explanation for your choice of categories. (More information is better; stories are great.)

You can use an existing walking tour from a book or app (GPS My City has several walking tour options) to guide you through the city, or you can simply explore on your own. Make sure you explore beyond the Stradun and the walls!)

You can walk with other students, but I'd prefer that you keep it to groups of no more than three, so that there's variation in what's seen and experienced. Whether you're solo or in a group, I'd like person to add at least five items. (Try to avoid duplicates, unless you have a very different experience of the same location/item.)

I expect your items, with category and description, to be added to the Siftr no later than 8pm on Tuesay, 23 January.
