#  Game Analysis Paper

Write an analysis of one or more location-based and/or tourism-focused games. It should be a game that you have access to here in Dubrovnik, so that you can observe yourself and others playing it. (However, if there's a game you don't have access to that you really want to write about, talk to me about it; it's possible that I'll still allow you to write about it if you can show me that there's sufficient information about gameplay and player experience to support a game analysis.)

If you are not sure if a game would be an appropriate choice, ask me.

## Requirements

### Game Details
At the beginning of the paper, you should fully identify the game you are analyzing, including the name of the publisher and designer (if available), and the year of publication or first appearance (again, if available). Cite your source(s) for this. 

### Platform/Requirements
What type of game is this? Mobile? Physical? Is it a single-player or a multi-player game? What are the requirements to play it? Does it require you to be in a specific defined location? Is/was it available only for a specific period of time? 

### Formal Elements
Identify the formal elements of the game, using the model of your choice. (Options include, but are not limited to, Fullerton's model from chapter 3 of Game Design Workshop, Hunicke et al's MDA model, or Greg Costikyan's essay ["I Have No Words & I Must Design"](costikyan.pdf).)

### Gameplay Experience and Dramatic Elements
Describe your experience of playing the game, as well as observations you have made of others playing it. Using the material from chapter 4 of the Fullerton book, LeBlanc's Taxonomy of Game Pleasures, or Costikyan's essay (linked above), analyze why it was fun (or not fun if that was the case)--for you as well as for anyone you observed playing it. 

If the game includes an explicit narrative, how was it provided? Was it linear or non-linear? Were there characters involved?  

Avoid using hyperbole and general adjectives such as "brilliant" or "great." Instead, explain why and how specific game elements work or do not work. You can also discuss how you think that specific elements could be modified to make the game better or more interesting. 

### Overall Assessement & Literature Review
In your opinion, was this game successful? If so, was it successful from both the developers' and the players' perspectives? Justify your assessment by using the materials you've read for class thus far (and any additional materials that you might find relevant or useful). Has the game been reviewed by others? If so, do you agree or disagreement with their assessments?  

## Citing Your Sources
Ideas and concepts that are not your original ideas ***must be cited***. Sources of factual material about the game ("it is the most popular card game ever", "it was the first game of type X ever released", "it received poor reviews", etc) must always be cited. Quotations must always be cited. Paraphrases must always be cited. 

## Mechanics
* The paper is due by noon on Saturday, 17 February. It must be submitted to the Dropbox in myCourses in Word (.doc or .docx) or PDF format. 
* It must be at least 1500 words in length, but no longer than 3000 words. (Word count does not include your name, the title, references, abstracts, etc.)
* It should be spell-checked and proofread. Proper grammar and word usage is required.
